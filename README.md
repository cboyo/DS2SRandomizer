This are the main files that write the param files for the randomizer.

This is not the full source code, I ommited the gui and some other minor parts.

THIS IS NOT GOOD CODE
When I started the project I mostly wanted to code things fast to be able to test them.
As time went on I kept building and patching on top so is a mess now. Specially the enemy tables are kinda weird.
